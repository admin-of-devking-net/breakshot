When you start a 3-Cushion Billiards game based on PBA Rules, you need nine cards with numbers from 1 to 9 to determine break position.

But if you don't have cards, how can you determine the break position?

This program was developed to help you make break positions based on PBA rules fairy and easly.

• When you start generating a new break position, nine cards are displayed.\
• A break position is determined by the user selecting three cards.\
• The results are displayed graphically to make it easier to place balls on the table.

Now anyone can enjoy a PBA rule-based 3-cushion billiard game in the club.
